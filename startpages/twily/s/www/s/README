Source code for Twily.info.


To host your own files you'll need a web server w/ php (+php zip extension), then place your files/folders in this directory.


Note: .htaccess is required to mask the url.
    Masked:     '.info/dir/file'
    Unmasked:   '.info/?p=dir/file'


Note2: If you want to change the name of this directory it must also be changed in /php/setup.php and /.htaccess.
    (There cannot be a file or directory in this directory with the same name as one that already exists in the parent directory).
