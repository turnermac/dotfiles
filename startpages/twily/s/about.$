So you've stumbled upon this site and having no idea what you're looking at?
<br />
<br />
Well first off;
<br />
&lt;-- that's me (Twily), owner and creator of this website.
<br />
<br />
I live in Norway and work in a factory for a living.
<br />This website has been a hobby project for me the last few years, originating from 4chan/<b>g</b> desktop threads.
<br />
<br />
So what is this website?
<br />
'Dotfiles'; scripts, configuration and customization files (mostly for linux).
<br />
(Oh and the website itself have been an experiment to me as well).
<br />
<br />
This site is an archive as much for me as for everyone else. Use it for what it is.
<br />
Files can be used 'as is', a 'framework' to build on or simply a 'reference guide' to look up stuff etc., customize and personalize them to your liking.
<br />
<br />
The files found around here are both stuff I still use and used to use.
<br />
Everything should be up to date to the last time I used it, however some things I no longer use and haven't updated in a long time may not work properly anymore.
<br />
<br />
You can use the 'sitemap' file to search for files and see when they where last updated.
<br />
<br />
If you want to see some of my scripts in action there are some videos and pictures in the 'stuff' directory.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy your stay ~ Twily :3
